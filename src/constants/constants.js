      "To implement better security features for our passwords, a note taking website is created and it requires the user to sign up with an actual email. Several features are implemented for the sign-up process. The user is required to create a strong password. Hashing will be done when the password is saved into the database so that the encryption is stronger, hence, preventing intruders from accessing the information that is stored in the system.",

      "The Asteroids version that is developed is similar to the arcade version of Asteroids. The idea of asteroids and saucers that were included in the original game are included as well as the endless method of playing the game. A choice to have a different theme is also introudced. The other theme will have a different saucer, a different asteroid as well as the spaceship. It has been modified into a more feminine theme with the use of donuts and cupcakes as the obstacles and a magic wand as the spaceship. There has been a change in visual effects and songs.",

      "The aim in this project is to find out whether machine learning model or fuzzy logic model is more accurate and suitable to predict whether a chemical is ready biodegradable (RB) or not ready biodegradable (NRB). The machine learning model which is the support vector machine has better performance than the fuzzy logic model. The accuracy score of the support vector machine using the test set is 0.87, while the accuracy score of the fuzzy logic model is 0.71.",
